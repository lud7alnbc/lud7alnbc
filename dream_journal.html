  <h3>dream at 8/10/2020 (day)</h3>
  i dreamt that my internet friend üñ•Ô∏è was messaging me telling me to wake up on discord. i just kept sleeping and did nothing because i was really really tired and just wanted to sleep. this dream was different in which it felt like i was awake while i was sleeping and i could tell what was going on around me. when i finally decided to wake up i checked my discord to see if they messaged me. they were not attempting to message me. 
  <h3>dream at 8/9/2020 (night)</h3>
  i dreamt that my mom made a big pot of ramen or some noodle soup and i wanted ice cream or a milkshake or something like that. my mom obliged and we both went to the mall to get ice cream. however we found out that the mall was one way and we had to go through this weird obstacle course. the place had people just chilling in the obstacle course and there were stores, places, and hang out spots (i.e. couches and stuff) along these obstacle course as though this was normal. there was stuff like long thin strips that you had to get across. my mom went through it as though it was easy while i went through slowly and carefully. this is the same with most of it where there were stuff like pillars of chairs you had to jump across a huge gap and stuff like that. most of the obstacles involved crossing huge gaps with what was given for you to be able to cross. these gaps though were scary to me, some of them had people walking below and lights too, but some gaps were deep and dark, where you couldnt tell where the drop ended. we eventually reached a slide where you had to slide down and get to the platform on the other side. then it was that obstacle again but this time you had to time the slide so you could make it through the hole. needlesss to say this obstacle was quite crowded. i got past the first slide, but had to backtrack later to get my backpack and then i went on the slide and me and my mom made it. there were a lot of familiar faces in the mall but nobody who i remember the names of.
