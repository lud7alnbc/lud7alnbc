  <h3>2nd dream at 8/11/2020 (day)</h3>
  i dreamt that my internet friend ðŸ¥œ was sending me hentai. like a fuckton of hentai. like hentai on discord and hentai on twitter and hentai on snapchat. they wouldnt fucking stop and just said "you like this?" "is this good?" "whats the source of this one?" or just nothing at all. i didnt really mind the whole dream and was enjoying it to a certain extent because it was pretty good hentai ngl. it eventually ended abruptly for no reason, it was just them sending a fuckton of hentai. it was a weird dream.

  <h3>1st dream at 8/11/2020 (day)</h3>
  i dreamt that me and my parents were gathering stuff to go camping, but it wasnt like camping more like going to a cabin that has stuff. maybe it was more like going to a house and just staying there idk. but anyways we did that and i was panicking because i needed to get everything i needed in the car. it was a struggle but i eventually got to it. we then drove off to a martial arts place that i went to when i was little. my mom went to get thai food for the trip bc it was nearby and me and my dad decided to go explore a bit. near the thai place i found a leaf with like a natural film on it that made it look colorful, looking like a peacock feather from a distance. i gave it to my dad bc he was feeling pretty down in the dumps for some reason. we went inside the martial arts place and found nothing there. when i got in i saw pictures and documents and i tore them off the wall on instinct. after realizing what i had done i stapled them back onto the wall messily. suddenly someone came in but they didnt mention the mess at all. mom came back with the food and my cousins and uncles had just arrived. we were ready to go on the trip, i got into the car, and we drove off. the dream ended there.

  <h3>dream at 8/10/2020 (night)</h3>
  i dreamt that there was this science experiment involving a snail. apparently we were testing about when this snail ate a tomato, he would eventually get faster and faster. he did get faster and faster, so fast that he started eating tomatos very fast. he soon became faster in his movemements kinda like that one snail from Turbo. It was a weird dream

  <h3>dream at 8/10/2020 (day)</h3>
  i dreamt that my internet friend ðŸ¥œ was messaging me telling me to wake up on discord. i just kept sleeping and did nothing because i was really really tired and just wanted to sleep. this dream was different in which it felt like i was awake while i was sleeping and i could tell what was going on around me. when i finally decided to wake up i checked my discord to see if they messaged me. they were not attempting to message me.

  <h3>dream at 8/9/2020 (night)</h3>
  i dreamt that my mom made a big pot of ramen or some noodle soup and i wanted ice cream or a milkshake or something like that. my mom obliged and we both went to the mall to get ice cream. however we found out that the mall was one way and we had to go through this weird obstacle course. the place had people just chilling in the obstacle course and there were stores, places, and hang out spots (i.e. couches and stuff) along these obstacle course as though this was normal. there was stuff like long thin strips that you had to get across. my mom went through it as though it was easy while i went through slowly and carefully. this is the same with most of it where there were stuff like pillars of chairs you had to jump across a huge gap and stuff like that. most of the obstacles involved crossing huge gaps with what was given for you to be able to cross. these gaps though were scary to me, some of them had people walking below and lights too, but some gaps were deep and dark, where you couldnt tell where the drop ended. we eventually reached a slide where you had to slide down and get to the platform on the other side. then it was that obstacle again but this time you had to time the slide so you could make it through the hole. needlesss to say this obstacle was quite crowded. i got past the first slide, but had to backtrack later to get my backpack and then i went on the slide and me and my mom made it. there were a lot of familiar faces in the mall but nobody who i remember the names of.
