  today i remembered my apecon/apgov teacher telling us before the pandemic started. she said that we are living in history as we know it and this is something we can tell our kids. she suggested we write a journal or diary and maybe one day it'll end up being published or as a book. i honestly doubt any diaries or journals will get published about this, or at least one in the united states or one by a young person or by a middle/upperclass american family. the pandemic literally is not that scary, its like flu or fever symptoms or something, so even if you get it in america youll most likely live. most teenagers don't even have much interesting to say about the pandemic. if anything theyll be talking about how bored they are or how it messed up their grades or something about how it made them stressed. maybe im just more apathetic towards the thing compared to others idk. i have no doubt that the pandemic will show up in history books, but actual interesting first hand accounts being considered important? probably not
