  <h3>Entry 8/10/2020</h3>
  today i did my morning workout and stuff. i apparently lost weight and bc of that it was suggested that i lift lighter and not go as heavy. it was also suggested that i try eating more in order to supplement the weight gain rather than working out at the moment. im fine with this ig but i still like working out bc its fun but w/e.
  <br> <br>
  other than that i told one of my friends, ‚úùÔ∏è, about this website. i wonder if he'll even check it out lol. speaking of friends, i didnt really talk to any today. i didnt talk to ü•ú as much as before but i guess thats fine. im sure shes busy with like other people or real life stuff. oh shit i just realized i didnt talk to üêº much today. i'll talk to him sometime later probably. i also tried to leave this discord group again but once again they wont let me. they know that i won't ever block my friends but honestly its getting kinda annoying. i also talked to ü•É and üßä a bit but just a short educational convo.
  <br> <br>
  other than that i just realized i did absolutely nothing today. i mean i made this website, so i guess that counts for something, but its not even that good. i dont do anything because im sick of everything. i like vtubers but its too much effort to read sometimes, all the other youtubers are tiring me out, all games are kinda boring me rn. im feeling drained again and i honestly dont know what to do. i hope thingsll get better soon bc rn this fucking sucks. my chest always feels tight, i always feel tense like something wrong is going to happen. i cant even relax and do nothing. my brain feels like it wants to do something but when i suggest something its like, "ehhhh i dont feel like it"
  <br> <br>
  anyays, it was a pretty shit day, i hope future days get better. goodbye for now journal.

  <h3>Entry 8/9/2020</h3>
  while this website will be worked on in depth tomorrow, i begin my journal today. i actually partially started it because i wanted a solid journal that i could consistently update and remember to   plus i kinda wanted to start it now that i finished highschool and i think its about time that i start trying to write about what's happening in my life, now that highschool isnt really there to hold my hand through stuff anymore.
  <br> <br>
  that aside this is what i did today. today i slept at 8am and woke up around 1 or 2 pm. i was just so addicted to the ffvii remake and i absolutely love the game. however i reached chapter 14 and that part feels like its mostly side quests and i get burnt out by those very easily. im probably going to take a small break from the game for now. i also played league of legends and talked with my friend: üêº. we talked about politics but i can tell that we werent too concerned with actual current politics and more just theoreticals.
  <br> <br>
  i also talked a bit with my internet friend ü•ú. i feel like we talked a bit more before today but its fine, im sure theyre probably pretty busy nowadays. my friend üßä's discord server is popping off and they just had an event today. i didn't do much about it. two people also got promoted in their server but i dont really care too much about it tbh. sometimes i wonder why they made me admin in the first place, or anybody makes me admin of any discord server. idk anything about managing one and i just end up standing on the sidelines literally doing nothing. its not like im the only admin who doesn't do much in that server anyways
  <br> <br>
  my parents also made hamburger helper today and i liked it. i ate 3 or 4 bowls today and actually ate some while i was typing the initial code of the website. i hope i can get more tomorrow because i left a good amount lol. nothing much happened today involving actually irl, i wish it did but you can always expect the pandemic to screw up your plans or what you want to do. my parents said it sounds kinda like i have a cabin fever type kinda thing, and maybe i do bc i really do wanna go outside.
  <br> <br>
  im actually starting uni soon and i absolutely wish that it wasn't online. the online thing and testing was kinda the whole reason why i flunked my ap tests. still passed all the classes though, so i guess you take the good with the bad.
  <br> <br>
  i actually wanna get something off my chest rn. i've been feeling so drained lately. nothing really excites me as much as before. i love working out, it makes me feel accomplished. and i love playing video games, its just fun and gives a sense of accomplishment too. i love talking with friends, they live different lives than me. i used to spend my time discord server hopping and playing video games, but its just not as fun as before lately. idk, maybe its just me. my friend said theyve been feeling kinda the same, but we didnt really go too in depth with the topic, kinda wish we did but that topic is done and gone by now lol.
  <br> <br>
  i think i wrote enough for now. goodbye for now journal.
